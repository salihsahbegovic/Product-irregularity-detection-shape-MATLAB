# Product-irregularity-detection-shape-MATLAB
Project task was to create a MATLAB application which will enable the user to test for product irregularities (shape). The user will upload a picture of the correct product, i.e. without irregularities.  After that, every new product that is manufactured should be tested by comparing it (its shape) with the correct product. The user will upload a pictures of the tested product and the application will give the user a message whether the product has irregularities or not, it will show the said irregularity in form of white pixels on the black background, and it will circle (locate) the irregularity on picture of the tested product.
